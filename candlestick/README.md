# RGB bulbs

Start with buing a set of LED spare bulbs for your candlestick, usually found at your grocery store, or where you found the candlestick.
It's important that it's LED bulbs, since regural bulbs is built as sealed glass bulbs containing a vacum that will implode if you're not very careful disassembling them.

Using a hacksaw, cut the bulb at the red line:

And remove the old boring LED:

Insert the RGB leds, glue in place, and solder on some extension wires. Pictures will be added in the future.

After inserting your custom made bulbs, the candlestick should look something like this:

Solder everything together, and verify that it works before assembling the candlestick again.
