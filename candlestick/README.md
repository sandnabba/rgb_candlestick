# Candlestick bulb

Start with buing a set of LED spare bulbs for your candlestick, usually found at your grocery store, or where you found the candlestick.
It's important that it's LED bulbs, since regural bulbs is built as sealed glass bulbs with a vacum, that will implode if you're not very careful disassembling them.
